My Story App is an application for people to view other people's stories. Users can also add their own stories. For this initial submission, I used technologies such as animation, LiveData, Retrofit, custom views, localization, MVVM architecture, and more. The stories available in My Story App are limited to those provided by Dicoding Academy's API
